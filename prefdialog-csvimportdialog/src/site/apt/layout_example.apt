Load and Save Layout Example

  The current layout can be saved in a file or output stream. The saved layout
can be loaded and set again from the file or from an input stream. The saving
and setting of the layout should be done in the AWT event thread. A
<<<PropertyChangeListener>>> can be set that is notified after the layout
is successfully set.

import bibliothek.gui.dock.common.theme.ThemeMap;

public void saveLayout(CsvImportDialog importDialog, OutputStream stream) {
    importDialog.saveLayout("name", stream);
}

public void loadLayout(CsvImportDialog importDialog, InputStream stream) {
    importDialog.loadLayout("name", stream);
}

public void loadLayout(CsvImportDialog importDialog, InputStream stream) {
    importDialog.loadLayout("name", stream, new PropertyChangeListener() {
        void propertyChange(PropertyChangeEvent evt) {
            log.info("Layout set.");
        }
    });
