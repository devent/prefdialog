This icon theme is a compilation of a few icon themes and a few sparse icons
found on www.deviantart.com and www.kde-look.org. It is by no means complete
but hopefully (in time) it will be. The theme is mostly based on the reflection
icon set by styrizo (http://styrizo.deviantart.com) 
and 
has
been enhanced with the minimal
perception set
and allblack
by mandarancio
(http://mandarancio.deviantart.com/)
and the ecqlipse icon set by http://chrfb.deviantart.com/. 
The script used to convert the icons is based on the one for Ekisho_Project
(http://www.kde-look.org/content/show.php/Ekisho_Project?content=55588).
The muon icon is a modification of the muon icon by user JOnas (http://kde-look.org/content/show.php/Muon+Icon?content=145610).
Thanks to user sfranzen for providing an svg version of the lyx icon!
The juk icon is a modification from Bespin.
 
The above creative authors have produced and keep doing an amazing work so I
wish to thank them and express my gratitude for granting me their permission to
create and share this compilation
theme. Thank you!
