Resource Actions

    * <<<com.anrisoftware.prefdialog.miscswing.resourcesaction.AbstractResourcesAction>>>

    Sets the action name and mnemonic from text resource. It is expected that
the user extends the <<<AbstractResourcesAction>>> in her own action class
and sets the texts and images resources. The name of the action is used to
look-up the resources for the action text, short text, mnemonic, accelerator,
small and large icon images.

    []

    The following suffixes are used to look-up the resources for the action,
attached to the action name.

    * <<<name>>> the action name as the action text;

    * <<<name_short>>> the short text of the action;

    * <<<name_mnemonic>>> the mnemonic of the action;

    * <<<name_accelerator>>> the accelerator key of the action;

    * <<<name_small_icon>>> the small icon image of the action;

    * <<<name_large_icon>>> the large icon image of the action;

Examples

    For example, if the action is named "cancel" then the following resource
should be used:

    <<<AppResources.properties>>>

cancel = com/anrisoftware/app/resources/texts/en/cancel_action.txt
cancel_short = com/anrisoftware/app/resources/texts/en/cancel_action_short.txt
cancel_mnemonic = com/anrisoftware/app/resources/texts/en/cancel_action_mnemonic.txt
cancel_accelerator = com/anrisoftware/app/resources/texts/en/cancel_action_accelerator.txt
cancel_small_icon = com/anrisoftware/app/resources/images/%s/cancel_action_small.png
